There are a few differences between a Graphical User Interface(GUI) and a Command-Line Interface(CLI), one of these being that a CLI allows for quicker managing of files and directories. These makes it a much faster process as opposed to what is considered the "traditional" interface, aka GUI. A CLI can also display more information. This would make it seem like a Command-Line Interface is more user-friendly, however, a Graphical User Interface also has it's advantages. For example, GUI offers a visual interface as opposed to CLI, which mainly uses command syntax. With the addition of icons and buttons that offer commands, a GUI can be easier to understand.
