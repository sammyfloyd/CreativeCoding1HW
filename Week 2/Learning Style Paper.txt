I think that learning styles are very important, maybe more so to some than others. Through personal experience, I have learned over the years that I am definitely a visual learner. I have struggled lots when it comes to learning through text or speech both in the workplace and at school. I've had to oftentimes ask to be shown something because my mind blanks when I try to remember the exact sequence of a task or whatnot. For example, with this coding class, I oftentimes have to go back and look at the videos to fully understand what to do rather than reading the text instructions. When I study I remember visually how my notes looked on the page and scour through them like that. I think that it is important to know what learning style you have to better accommodate for yourself but I believe that there is also a lack in knowledge of how exactly to do that. We aren't taught how to study for each learning style and it's not all black and white, unfortunately. Different studying techniques work for different people, even within our learning types.
