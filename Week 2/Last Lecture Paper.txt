I thought that the Last Lecture video was very interesting and I actually found it really inspiring. The thing that affected me the most was that the man giving the lecture was found to have about 10 tumors in his liver and given only a couple more months to live. He says this and yet, there he was, giving a lecture on achieving your childhood dreams instead of holing up and isolating himself in his last moments. He had mentioned how he is going to keep going through life with his hands on the reins and I look up to his persistence. It make me realize that it's not too late to do the same. Another thing that really stood out to me was the fact that in the course of his 1 hour lecture, he managed to retell so many of his crazy experiences that most people don't even think of doing realistically because it simply seems impossible. So many people, including myself, believe that they can't achieve much because they are just a miniscule part of a whole, giant world. If I learned anything from the lecture it's that we all can, as long as we have the drive to do so. 

One of his messages that I identified with was to keep the childhood-like wonder with us. I truly believe that it is so sad that once we grow up, we have this standard that we can't get too excited about things that we're interested in and we have to not care so much. I used to have this mindset from 6th grade through senior year of high school. Even as a child I was so worried about being judged for my authentic interests that I pretended I thought they were boring and "so not cool". I have since then realized that I only live once and what's the point in living when I am not authentic to myself. Because of this, I have been much happier. The world could definitely do with more wonder.
